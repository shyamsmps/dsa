/**
 * Every positive fraction can be represented as the sum of its unique unit fractions.
 * A fraction is a unit fraction if the numerator is 1 and the denominator is a positive integer.
 * For example, 1/3 is a unit fraction. Such a representation is called Egyptian fraction.
 *
 * We can generate Egyptian fractions using the greedy algorithm.
 * For a given number of the form n/d, where d > n, first find the greatest possible unit fraction, and then perform recursion for the remaining part.
 *
 * For example, consider 6/14. We first find the ceiling of 14/6, i.e., 3, so the first unit fraction becomes 1/3
 * Now subtract 1/3 out of 6/14 and recur
 * We use the greedy algorithm because we want to reduce the fraction to a form where the denominator is greater than the numerator and the numerator doesnâ€™t divide the denominator.
 *
 * The method is to find the biggest unit fraction we can and subtract it from the remaining fraction.
 * Doing subtractions always decreases this group of unit fractions, but it never repeats a fraction and eventually will stop, which is why we call this approach greedy.
